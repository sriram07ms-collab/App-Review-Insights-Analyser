In candle view of graph, it is not possible to click on every candle to check open, close, high, low and volume in android. When I click to one candle and slid my finger it often jumps 2 or 3 candles. But it is quite possible to navigate through each and every candle in iPhone. I hope it gets fixed soon. I will update my review after this bug is fixed in android.",

    "text": "Hello Groww Team, I would like to share some feedback regarding the investment tracking in the app. I have invested a total of ₹43,502.36 in Groww shares. I sold shares worth ₹15,600, so my remaining investment should be ₹28,402.36. However, the app currently shows only ₹25,697. This creates confusion for users trying to track their investments accurately. It would be great if the app could display the correct remaining investment amount to improve transparency and trust. Thank you",

They appear to be in a hurry to close the chat and often end the conversation on their own without confirming whether the issue has been resolved. After the first query is submitted, there is no opportunity to ask follow-up questions or seek clarification on the solution they provide. Whether the response is understood or helpful seems irrelevant, as the chat is abruptly closed.",
