    "text": "Hi, When we talk about brokerage platforms in India, Groww is one of the top names and is often considered among the No.1 brokers. However, there is one serious issue that I have been noticing for a long time. Whenever we do options buying, the app often lags or hangs, especially during high volatility. This glitch has happened many times and has caused significant losses. I sincerely want to request the Groww team to please look into this issue and bring a new update or improvement in the app",

    "text": "07/12/2025 I have been using this app for some time now. But when I started intraday trading, i encountered its high slippage. For example, I book a trade at a profit of around 12000 using their exit button, the executed amount would be 10000. There have been times when booked a profit of more than 2000 still the executed profit was not only less but in loss -749. This is higly disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new broker app. Too much Fraud app. I have lost 20000 rupees on this app. Hence",
