# Product Pulse: November 17-23, 2025
_Week: 2025-11-17 - 2025-11-23_

This week's pulse identifies critical issues with app stability, causing login failures and feature inaccessibility. Payments experienced challenges with non-functional Autopay and extended withdrawal times for urgent needs. While overall UI/UX is praised, a specific drag-and-drop flaw led to missed trades, indicating areas for focused improvement.

## Themes
- **Slow, Glitches** - Users reported significant app instability and login failures, severely hindering access to features like Digi Gold investment for multiple days.
- **UI/UX** - Though generally user-friendly, a critical flaw in the drag-and-drop system is causing users to miss trades due to required manual input.
- **Payments/Statements** - Critical payment functionalities are failing, with Autopay repeatedly unsuccessful and withdrawal processing times deemed excessively long during urgent situations.

## Quotes
- "Not working since last 5 days (Slow, Glitches)"
- "pls update drag and drop system in target and stop manual type karne jaye hai to trade miss ho jata hai (UI/UX)"
- "Withdrawal time is too long, It's an emergency right now and we have to wait for 4 days.😡 (Payments/Statements)"

## Actions
- Prioritize investigation and resolution of core app stability, login failures, and feature accessibility (e.g., Digi Gold).
- Enhance the drag-and-drop trading interface to prevent manual input errors and ensure trade execution without delays.
- Address Autopay functionality failures and optimize withdrawal processing times to meet user expectations, especially for urgent needs.
