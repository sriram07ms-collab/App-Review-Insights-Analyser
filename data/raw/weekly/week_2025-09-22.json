    "text": "Heard about it from a friend. But had to immediately uninstalled. At initial setup, it's too easy to accidentally choose some options. You can't go back and correct the choices. And these can not be changed later in settings as well. Also it's terrible at account deletion. Once in, it's a nightmare to exit. Do not get into the trap!",
