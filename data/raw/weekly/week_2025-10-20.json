    "text": "The app is becoming worse day by day. I have seen too many glitches in the recent days, sometimes wallet balance is incorrect, sometimes login doesn't work, sometimes you can't make payments etc etc. With every glitch, my trust is eroding from this app. Update (23 Oct 2025) - I don't think they are able to handle the volume of transactions happening on their platform. Glitches still occur and now happen repeatedly. Price alerts for ETFs do not work at all.",
