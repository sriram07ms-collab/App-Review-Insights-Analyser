    "text": "I'm very disappointed with this app. Used to like this app because of it's super fast order placements and simple UI. but on 14th October, I was placing my order to sell shares of LG at 50% but due to some error I wasn't able to sell. I tried 4 times but it failed. After 15minutes, I did sell the shares but at less profit at 44%. Hence I was able to book less profit. If such problem continues I may suffer a huge loss in the future. that's why I don't want to use this app anymore.",
